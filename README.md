#Rideshare_Analysis

Create a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:
  - Average Fare ($) Per City
  - Total Number of Rides Per City
  - Total Number of Drivers Per City
  - City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
  
Create three pie charts showing:
  - % of Total Fares by City Type
  - % of Total Rides by City Type
  - % of Total Drivers by City Type


Pyber Rideshare Analysis Observations

Of the drivers located in urban cities (80.9%), they make up 68.4% of rides and 62.7% in fares in urban cities. This implies the urban market is potentially oversaturated. More analysis of the previous years data may be able to uncover if this is trending up which points to driver oversaturation in urban cities, or trending down which implies the market for drivers is correcting itself.

Looking at the bubble plot, the average fare for rural cities seems to be higher in general compared to suburban and urban cities. The higher average fare in rural cities could be due to major events in a larger city, airport travel, or weekend entertainment. Further research should be done to determine how our rural customers are using Pyber and how we can potentially capitalize on the most frequent use.

In terms of potential driver rentention, the data shows drivers on the Pyber platform may be able to earn more money per ride by shifting from urban cities to suburban and rural cities. More research could be done to include times that may yield a highger likelyhood of a higher average fare that can be given to drivers. Allowing drivers to get a better sense of the ride potential in any given city may lead to drivers who are willing to work on our platform longer.
